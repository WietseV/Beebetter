## Bee Better

The scope of this project is to create a good looking blog. This blog will then serve me to write articles that helped me improve my life. Maybe later others could add articles as well but best to keep it simple in the beginning. The point would be thus an overview page with all the posts with most recent first. Possibly with a search function based on the tags that I can assign to my post. Then Each post will get it's proper pages as well with dynamic page. Lastly I want to make a create page where I can write my post and put in all the information and the post will then be uploaded to the newsfeed. 

The project will be build with nextjs 13, Typescript and tailwindcss since this is currently the technology where I am most comfortable in and probably run on vercel. As for what I will use as DB for the posts and user authentication I might consider firebase or explore other options. Once this has been decided it will be updated here.
